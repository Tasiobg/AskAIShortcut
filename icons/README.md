# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using:

1. **Online tools:**
   - favicon.io
   - canva.com
   - figma.com

2. **Quick placeholder:**
   You can use any PNG images of the correct sizes as placeholders for testing.

3. **Design suggestions:**
   - Use a lightbulb or shopping cart icon
   - Colors that match the button gradient (purple/blue)
   - Simple and recognizable design

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares in any image editor
2. Use free icon generators online
3. Download free icons from flaticon.com or icons8.com (with proper attribution)

The extension will work without icons, but browsers may show warnings.
